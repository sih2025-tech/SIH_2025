# 🌦️ AgroSetu — Hyperlocal Weather Intelligence & Smart Agro Advisory (Agro-GPT)

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
**AgroSetu (Agro-GPT)** is an **AI-driven agricultural intelligence platform** that delivers **hyperlocal weather forecasts**, **crop advisories**, and **data-driven insights** to farmers.  
It bridges the gap between technology and agriculture by combining **satellite imagery, IoT sensors, and AI models** into one unified decision-support system.  

While its **core USP** lies in *farm-level hyperlocal weather prediction*, AgroSetu extends far beyond — offering **personalized crop management, pest alerts, and market insights** through an **interactive web and mobile interface**.

---

## 🌾 Key Objectives
- Deliver **5–10 day hyperlocal weather forecasts** at farm-level accuracy.  
- Provide **AI-generated crop, pest, and irrigation advisories**.  
- Fuse **satellite, IoT, and meteorological data** for high-precision insights.  
- Offer a **multilingual, voice-enabled chatbot and mobile dashboard**.  
- Support **data-driven, climate-resilient agriculture**.  

---

## 🧠 Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet Maps  
- **Backend:** Python (Flask / FastAPI), Node.js  
- **AI/ML Models:** LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + PostGIS for geospatial data  
- **APIs:** Google Earth Engine, IMD, OpenWeatherMap  
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** AWS / GCP for scalable deployment

## 📊 Core Components
- 🌦️ **Hyperlocal Weather Engine** – Predicts rainfall, temperature, and humidity at farm-level granularity.  
- 🛰️ **Satellite Analytics** – Uses Sentinel-2 data for NDVI, vegetation, and soil moisture mapping.  
- 🌾 **AI-Powered Crop Advisory** – Recommends irrigation schedules and pest prevention actions.  
- 💬 **Multilingual Chatbot** – Provides personalized support and weather alerts.  
- 📱 **Mobile & Web Dashboard** – Displays forecast trends and crop health data visually.  

---

## 💡 Impact
AgroSetu empowers farmers to make **informed, data-driven decisions** that improve yield, conserve resources, and minimize losses due to unpredictable weather.  
By merging **hyperlocal intelligence** with **AI-driven advisories**, it acts as a **complete digital assistant for smart agriculture**.

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Integration of **real-time IoT sensor streams** from farms.  
- **Offline & voice-first interface** for remote areas.  
- **Market trend prediction** and **crop recommendation** modules.
